# simple-authenticator
A simple javascript framework for authentication.

This javascript framework is ideal for small-scale projects or testing apps in development and operates on the principles of simplicity, ease of understanding, and minimal dependencies. Its purpose is to abstract any authentication-related functionality for the developer
so that energy and resources can be committed to other more important parts of a test app or project.
